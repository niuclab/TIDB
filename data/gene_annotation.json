        "Summary": "The serine-threonine protein kinase encoded by the AKT1 gene is catalytically inactive in serum-starved primary and immortalized fibroblasts. AKT1 and the related AKT2 are activated by platelet-derived growth factor. The activation is rapid and specific, and it is abrogated by mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1. It was shown that the activation occurs through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In the developing nervous system AKT is a critical mediator of growth factor-induced neuronal survival. Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/threonine kinase AKT1, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery. Mutations in this gene have been associated with the Proteus syndrome. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2011]",

This gene (FCGR3A) is highly similar to another nearby gene (FCGR3B) located on chromosome 1. The receptor encoded by this gene is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells as an integral membrane glycoprotein anchored through a transmembrane peptide, whereas FCGR3B is expressed on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) where the receptor is anchored through a phosphatidylinositol (PI) linkage. Mutations in this gene have been linked to susceptibility to recurrent viral infections, susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]",

        "Summary": "The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis). This gene and other members of the CXC chemokine gene family form a gene cluster in a region of chromosome 4q. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]",

After removal of the precursor signal peptide, proinsulin is post-translationally cleaved into three peptides: the B chain and A chain peptides, which are covalently linked via two disulfide bonds to form insulin, and C-peptide. Binding of insulin to the insulin receptor (INSR) stimulates glucose uptake. A multitude of mutant alleles with phenotypic effects have been identified, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, permanent neonatal diabetes diabetes mellitus, maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 10 and hyperproinsulinemia. There is a read-through gene, INS-IGF2, which overlaps with this gene at the 5' region and with the IGF2 gene at the 3' region. [provided by RefSeq, May 2020]",

The activation of this kinase requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Upon activation, this kinase translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cells, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. One study also suggests that this protein acts as a transcriptional repressor independent of its kinase activity. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein, but differing in the UTRs, have been reported for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]",

        "Summary": "The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. This kinase is activated by various cell stimuli, and targets specific transcription factors, and thus mediates immediate-early gene expression in response to cell stimuli. The activation of this kinase by tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is found to be required for TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. This kinase is also involved in UV radiation induced apoptosis, which is thought to be related to cytochrom c-mediated cell death pathway. Studies of the mouse counterpart of this gene suggested that this kinase play a key role in T cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2016]",

TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This receptor has been implicated in signal transduction events induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in most gram-negative bacteria. Mutations in this gene have been associated with differences in LPS responsiveness. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This gene is predominantly expressed in lung, placenta, and spleen, and lies in close proximity to another family member, TLR8, on chromosome X. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]",

The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]",

This gene is one of a cluster of beta-hemoglobin genes that are distally regulated by a locus control region, and which are organized along the chromosome in the order of their developmental expression. In mouse, two major strain-specific haplotypes of the beta-globin gene cluster are found - a \"single\" haplotype found in C57BL/-type strains, which includes two highly similar adult beta-globin genes, beta s and beta t, and a \"diffuse\" haplotype found in strains such as BALB/c and 129Sv, which includes two somewhat diverse adult beta-globin genes, beta-major and beta-minor. This gene represents the beta-major adult gene found in the \"diffuse\" haplotype. Primary chromosome 7 of the mouse reference genome assembly, which is derived from C57BL/6 strain mice, represents the \"single\" haplotype, while the \"diffuse\" haplotype is represented in the reference genome collection by the BALB/c strain alternate contig, NT_095534.1.

The encoded protein is secreted by cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems and is crucial for limiting the immune response to a broad range of pathogens. It also has been shown to suppress autoimmune responses. This protein mediates it's immunosuppressive signal through a specific interleukin 10 receptor complex. Aberrant functioning of this gene is associated with numerous immune disorders including graft-versus-host disease, and increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and rheumatoid arthritis.

The receptor encoded by this gene mediates the innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, through synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In addition, this protein can recognize other pathogens from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as viral components. Mice deficient in this gene display a number of immune response-related phenotypes including hyporesponsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and increased levels of respiratory syncytial virus compared to controls.

The encoded protein regulates angiogenesis in endothelial cells, and is inhibited by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin. Based on its ability to function as both a cyclooxygenase and as a peroxidase, the encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]",
